| **Start**      | Displays topic and start button using `gameStarted` state                   |
| **Question**   | Shows progress (3/10) and shuffles answers using Fisher-Yates algorithm      |
| **Answer**     | Disables buttons after selection, shows color-coded feedback for 1.5 seconds|
| **Transition** | Automatically advances after feedback using `setTimeout`                    |

**State Management:**
{/* Code block removed due to potential MDX parsing issues */}
- **`useState`** manages 7 state variables for game progression
- **`useEffect`** reshuffles answers when question changes
- **`useMemo`** caches current question to prevent unnecessary rerenders
- **`useCallback`** memoizes answer handler to maintain reference equality

**Answer Handling:**
{/* Code block removed due to potential MDX parsing issues */}
- Combines correct/incorrect answers
- Randomizes order each question
- Prevents pattern memorization

**UI Styling Approach:**
1. **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
2. Dynamic class generation:
   {/* Code block removed due to potential MDX parsing issues */}
3. Planned \"Millionaire\" theming:
- Gradient backgrounds
- Animated transitions
- Score progress indicators

**Question Set Structure:**
{/* Code block removed due to potential MDX parsing issues */}
- Hebrew UTF-8 text support
- Grouped by historical chapters
- Easy to extend with new sets

**Usage Example:**
{/* Code block removed due to potential MDX parsing issues */}

This component demonstrates modern React patterns with TypeScript type safety, making it easy to maintain and extend while providing an engaging learning experience.
