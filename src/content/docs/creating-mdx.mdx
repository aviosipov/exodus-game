MDX allows you to write Markdown documents and embed interactive JSX components within them. This guide explains how to create new documentation pages using MDX for this project.

## File Structure

All documentation pages should reside within the `src/content/docs/` directory. You can organize pages into subdirectories as needed.

## Basic Structure

An MDX file typically starts with **frontmatter**, followed by the main content written in Markdown.

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is written in YAML format between triple-dashed lines (`---`) at the very top of the file. It provides metadata about the page.

Key frontmatter properties used in this project (based on Starlight defaults):

-   `title`: (Required) The main title of the page, displayed prominently.
-   `description`: (Optional) A brief description of the page content, often used for SEO and previews.
-   `editUrl`: (Optional) Set to `false` to disable the "Edit page" link if needed.
-   `sidebar`: (Optional) Customize sidebar behavior (e.g., `label`, `order`, `hidden`). See [Starlight Sidebar Docs](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/) for details.

**Example Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
title: My Awesome Documentation Page
description: Learn all about the awesome features.
sidebar:
  label: Awesome Features
  order: 3
---
```

### Content

Below the frontmatter, write your content using standard Markdown syntax.

```markdown
---
title: Example Page
description: This is an example MDX page.
---

# Heading 1

This is standard Markdown text. You can use **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and [links](https://example.com).

## Heading 2

- Create lists
- Like this one

> Blockquotes are also supported.

Code blocks:
```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello from MDX!');
}
```
```

## Using Components

MDX shines when you embed interactive components written in frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, or Astro.

<Steps>
1.  **Import the Component:**
    Use standard JavaScript/TypeScript import syntax at the top of your file (after frontmatter). See the code example below the steps for syntax.

2.  **Use the Component:**
    Embed the component using JSX syntax directly within your Markdown where needed. See the code example below the steps for syntax.

</Steps>

Here are examples showing the *code* for importing and using components within MDX:

**Importing:**
```jsx
import MyComponent from '../../components/MyComponent.astro';
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
```

**Using:**

```jsx
<Card title="Important Note">
  Remember to import components before using them!
</Card>

{/* Example of a custom component */}
{/* <MyComponent prop1="value" /> */}
```

## Best Practices

-   Keep frontmatter concise and accurate.
-   Use semantic Markdown (correct heading levels, lists, etc.).
-   Organize content logically with clear headings.
-   Leverage Starlight's built-in components (`Card`, `CardGrid`, `Tabs`, `Aside`, etc.) for enhanced documentation formatting. Refer to the [Starlight Components Guide](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/).
-   If creating custom components, ensure they are well-documented and placed in an appropriate project directory (e.g., `src/components/`).
